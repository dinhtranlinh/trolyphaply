      "scene_description": "Cut to a bright, modern delivery room in a Vietnamese hospital in Da Nang. A Vietnamese doctor in clean white uniform gently hands the newborn baby to the mother lying on the bed, while a nurse smiles supportively. The camera then glides to a nearby desk where a medical staff member is entering information on a computer. On the screen we see a clear English-language digital birth record form. When the staff member clicks a button labeled 'Submit event', the form emits a soft glow and a notification symbol appears above it, showing that the proactive system has detected the need for related administrative procedures.",
      "data_visualization": "The digital birth record icon sends out three small neon streams labeled in English as 'Birth certificate', 'Residence' and 'Health insurance'. These streams travel toward the central 'Proactive e-Administration System' core, illustrating that the system is automatically identifying which procedures are needed based on a single real-world event.",
      "camera": "Use a gentle tracking shot from the mother and baby to the side desk and monitor. As the medical staff member submits the event, move into a close-up on the screen, then perform a short fly-out that follows the three neon streams as they leave the birth record and head toward the central core.",
