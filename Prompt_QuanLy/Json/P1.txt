      "scene_description": "Open on a medium shot of a Vietnamese couple in their small but tidy apartment in Da Nang, holding their newborn baby. On the coffee table there is a messy pile of paper forms, household registration booklets and application envelopes. The parents look tired and a bit overwhelmed. The camera slowly pulls back to reveal a stylized digital map of Da Nang appearing in the air above the table, with multiple red pins marking different government offices. After a brief moment, all of the red pins fade out and are replaced by one central glowing icon labeled in English as 'Proactive e-Administration System' floating in the middle of the scene, hinting that a new, data-driven model is being introduced under the policy framework.",
      "data_visualization": "Around the central system icon, multiple neon light streaks in blue and green begin to flow inwards from the corners of the frame, representing many separate procedures converging into one integrated process. A soft, shimmering digital river appears beneath the icon, suggesting that complex paper-based steps are being transformed into streamlined digital data flows that will be used for management and service delivery.",
      "camera": "Start with a medium eye-level shot on the family, then slowly dolly backward to reveal the floating digital map and pins. Transition to a slightly elevated angle that clearly shows the unified system icon in the center as the red pins dissolve and the neon data streams appear.",
      "onscreen_text": "From paper-based procedures to a data-driven proactive system."
