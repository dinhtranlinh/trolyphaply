This includes titles, headers, labels, button captions, tooltips, status messages and database names. All visible UI and documents must be built only from icons, shapes, color blocks, progress bars, simple pictograms and abstract symbols. If a button, card, header bar, folder, database block or document would normally contain text, show it as a plain shape or a solid color bar with no characters, or as a blurred area where no individual letters can be recognized. IMPORTANT: All words and phrases in this prompt are instructions only and must NEVER appear as on-screen text. Do not copy or approximate any of these words (such as 'owner', 'national population database', 'food business case', etc.) into the video. If the model starts to create any letters or pseudo-words, replace them with neutral visual noise or blur so that nothing is legible.",

This includes avoiding sequences of vertical\/horizontal strokes, repeated patterns that look like alphabetic characters, or grouped rectangles that suggest paragraph lines. If the model attempts to create any UI block that usually contains text, it must render it as one of the following only: (1) a solid color rectangle with NO inner marks, (2) a soft blurred patch with NO distinguishable symbols, (3) a gradient bar with zero internal shapes. Completely prohibit pseudo-text, scrambled text, or noise text such as 'ownen', 'repsihciert', 'populitue', or any invented word. If text generation is attempted, immediately replace it with abstract texture or smooth blur. NEVER render any icon or block that contains placeholder lines representing text."
