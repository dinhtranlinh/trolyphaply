Use only one or two calm colors, mainly light gray and soft blue, with no gradients or flashy effects. The icons are flat, simple and clearly spaced. IMPORTANT: do not render any letters, words or numbers anywhere in the image. No labels, no titles, no captions. The idea of the linked process is shown only by the line and the three icons connected to the central circle.",
