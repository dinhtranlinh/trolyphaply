      "scene_description": "Open on a medium shot of a Vietnamese couple in their small but tidy apartment in Da Nang, holding their newborn baby. On the coffee table there is a messy pile of paper forms, household registration booklets and application envelopes. The parents look tired and a bit overwhelmed. The camera slowly pulls back to reveal a stylized digital map of Da Nang appearing in the air above the table, with multiple red pins marking different government offices. After a brief moment, all of the red pins fade out and are replaced by one central glowing icon labeled in English as 'Proactive e-Administration System' floating in the middle of the scene, hinting that a new, data-driven model is being introduced under the policy framework.",
      "data_visualization": "Around the central system icon, multiple neon light streaks in blue and green begin to flow inwards from the corners of the frame, representing many separate procedures converging into one integrated process.

A Vietnamese doctor in clean white uniform gently hands the newborn baby to the mother lying on the bed, while a nurse smiles supportively. The camera then glides to a nearby desk where a medical staff member is entering information on a computer. On the screen we see a clear English-language digital birth record form.
